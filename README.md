## Scenario
The initial structure of our project consists of various materials, 3D assets, and audio files. The purpose of this first version is to test the arrangement and appearance of colors, and thus it may differ from the final version. Here are the key components:

### Boxes with Hands and Feet:

Utilized .png files for texture and design.
Terrain: Used the "Terrain Sample Asset Pack" from the Unity Asset Store to establish the terrain material of the plane.
City Park Simulation: Incorporated 3D assets from the "Low Poly Environment Park" package to create the experience of being in a city park.
Environmental Audio: Added a .wav file from Freesound to simulate birds singing and enhance the environment's audio experience.
