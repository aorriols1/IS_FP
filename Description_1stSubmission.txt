--> Scenario:

The scenario of the initial structure of our project consists of different materials, 3D assets and audio files.
For all the boxes with hands and feet, we used some .png files that we had.
Notice that this first version of the environment will not be as the final one, because we wanted to test the colors disposal.

We first used a "Terrain Sample Asset Pack" from the asset store, 
which is useful for stablishing the terrain material of the plane.

Then, some 3D assets that we used to simulate the experience of being in a city park, 
were obtained through this "Low Poly Environment Park" package from the asset store.

We also added a .wav file from Freesound to put some environmental audio source, 
which is simulating birds singing.
